## **Challenge Instructions**

* The goal of this challenge is to create a workflow that will input data from a spreadsheet into the form fields on the screen.
* Beware! **The fields will change position on the screen after every submission** throughout 10 rounds thus the workflow must correctly identify where each spreadsheet record must be typed every time.
* The actual countdown of the challenge will begin once you click the "Start" button until then you may submit the form as many times as you wish without receiving penalties.

_You can check out **my RPA solution** to the challenge in the **demo video** below_:
